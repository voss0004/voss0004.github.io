<h1>My name is Sarah Voss and I am a Graphic Designer.</h1>


<p>I am currently completing my third year of graphic design studies at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Ontario. I truly love designing, whether it is branding, print, or logo design. I also enjoy motion graphics and web design/coding. I love to challenge myself in any way possible. My designs reflect my personality because they are lively and vibrant. I love exciting designs filled with bright colours and bold fonts.  <br>I hope to one day have my own graphic design studio located in Toronto. I am very excited to start gaining more experience in graphic design and see what this industry has to offer!</br> </p>
